Finally did it! I built a CLI gem that scrapes the Trader Joe's website and provides information on their six featured products. The code itself was simpler than I expected, and my biggest obstacles throughout this project were mental ones that I set up myself. Having eventually gotten past those I peeked one eye open, looked around and realized it wasn't so bad after all -- like roller coasters, or Brussels sprouts once you realize they're often served with bacon. 

I admittedly still do not feel like I've mastered the object orientation curriculum, but I do have a better understanding of the component parts of a gem and of some of the ways that relationships between objects can be useful. I was nervous about having to narrate videos explaining my gem, but that actually turned out to be a helpful exercise in [Rubber Duck Debugging](https://rubberduckdebugging.com/) that I might've been too chicken to try otherwise.

My advice to those starting this project would be:
* Watch Avi's Daily Deal CLI walkthrough video that's linked in the project description before doing anything
* Choose a topic or site that you're actually interested in and/or knowledgeable about, it'll help you see how the objects are supposed to fit together if the individual pieces are already memorable and familiar
* If it seems daunting, just rip off the bandaid and get started anyways. I would've been done much sooner if I'd just followed my own advice.
