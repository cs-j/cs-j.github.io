React • Ruby on Rails • WebSockets • Action Cable • CodeMirror Text Editor • JavaScript

Editr is a collaborative code editor with a chat feature that I built with another student at Flatiron School. The implementation of Action Cable allowed us to integrate WebSockets that displayed live changes for both users with a React frontend and persisted those changes to a Ruby on Rails backend.
