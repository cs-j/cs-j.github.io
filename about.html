<p>Iâ€™m a full stack web developer with experience in Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, and React and a passion for design and building things that matter. I get excited about puzzles, linguistics and thoughtful writing that strikes a balance between brevity and expressivity. My experience in client-facing roles supplements my technical skills with the ability to work collaboratively, communicate well, and lead teams effectively. I am also always interested in talking about web accessibility, dim sum, and anything that makes you tick!</p>
