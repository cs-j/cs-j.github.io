<p>I recently graduated from the University of Wisconsin with a BA in International Studies and minors in cheese and beer. Currently in NYC and learning full stack web development at Flatiron in an apparent effort (successful, thus far) to make that clueless freshman feeling an every-four-years thing. Also proud that I successfully resisted the urge to name this blog Git 'er Done.</p>
